Subject: Update: ODrP BV Automation & Eflex Endpoint Integration

Hi Siva,

I am pleased to share that we have successfully developed the ODrP BV automation with the enhancements you suggested. Key achievements include:
	•	ODrP BV Automation
	•	Developed with additional tweaks for flexibility and efficiency.
	•	Can now be executed independently at any time, removing dependency on Eflex.
	•	Supports parallel execution alongside the main batch without impacting the original process.
	•	Enables quick validation of rates displayed in letters, improving accuracy and reducing manual checks.
	•	Eflex Endpoint Integration
	•	Eflex team has created a new endpoint to fetch daily stats directly from their system.
	•	This eliminates the need for manual posting of stats by the Eflex team.
	•	By triggering the endpoint through Postman, we can generate data in a tabular format and share instantly in the chat.
	•	This improvement significantly reduces dependency on Eflex and streamlines daily reporting.

These enhancements not only reduce manual effort but also ensure faster turnaround and greater reliability in our processes.

Thanks & Regards,
[Your Name]
