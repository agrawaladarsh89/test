Subject: Urgent: Factflow Login and OTP Email Issue – INC9230756

Hi Team,

We are currently facing an issue with Factflow login, where users are unable to receive OTP emails. This is an intermittent issue impacting all three brands.

Incident Reference: INC9230756 (already assigned)

Impact:
Factflow is a customer-facing application under Lending – Invoice Finance, operating 24x7. Due to this issue, users are unable to log in as OTP emails are not being delivered because of an EWS server error (details attached).

The Messaging team has already restarted all 16 Exchange servers as part of their troubleshooting process.

We are currently on a call to discuss this issue – [Zoom Link: zoom-meet.kalyani].

Kindly treat this as a high-priority incident. The issue has been ongoing for almost 4 hours, and the root cause is still unidentified. Immediate attention is required to restore service availability.

Thanks and Regards,
