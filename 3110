Got it 👍 — you’ve shared a screenshot of an SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) Maturity Assessment sheet for UDRP with sections like Service & Reliability, Incident Management & Response, and Automation & Toil Reduction.

Here are sample positive (mature-level) answers for each question visible in your screenshot. You can adapt wording as per your team’s actual practices:

⸻

🟣 Service and Reliability

Q6: Is your service definition documented in customer-friendly terms, with clear customer journeys and expectations?
✅ Yes, service definitions are well-documented in customer-facing language, with detailed user journeys, SLAs, and dependencies clearly mapped in Confluence. These are regularly reviewed during service reviews.

Q7: Do you have defined SLOs and SLIs for your services and are they aligned with customer expectations?
✅ Yes, each service has defined and agreed-upon SLOs/SLIs that align with business KPIs. These are tracked in dashboards (Grafana/DataDog) and reviewed monthly with stakeholders.

Q8: Do you review and adjust your SLOs based on real-world performance, and are they aligned with customer expectations?
✅ Yes, SLOs are reviewed quarterly based on production data trends, customer feedback, and incident patterns to ensure alignment with evolving expectations.

Q9: When SLO breaches occur, do you have structured budget policies and responses in place?
✅ Yes, error budget policies are defined. Breaches trigger a review in the next sprint, pausing feature development if required, to prioritize reliability improvements.

🟣 Incident Management & Response

Q15: Is your incident response process documented? Is it clear to all teams?
✅ Yes, the incident management process is fully documented in the internal runbook. All teams have access and are trained during onboarding and quarterly refreshers.

Q16: Have you integrated chaos testing to validate resilience, and is it applied in regular, structured scenarios?
✅ Yes, chaos testing is integrated into pre-production environments using tools like Gremlin/Chaos Monkey. Regular quarterly chaos drills validate service resilience.

Q17: Are PIRs (Post Incident Reviews) conducted after significant incidents, with action items feeding back into process improvement?
✅ Yes, PIRs are mandatory for all SEV-1/SEV-2 incidents. Lessons learned and action items are tracked in Jira until closure and reviewed in weekly reliability syncs.

Q18: Do you conduct incident response drills and review them for actionable improvements?
✅ Yes, we conduct quarterly incident simulation drills (game days). Key learnings are logged and used to improve runbooks, alerting, and escalation processes.

Q19: Do you have a clear on-call rotation with automated alerts and runbooks?
✅ Yes, an automated on-call schedule is managed through PagerDuty. Alerts are routed based on severity, and detailed runbooks are linked within each alert.

⸻

🟣 Automation & Toil Reduction

Q20: Do you dedicate a percentage of your team’s time as Error Budget?
✅ Yes, approximately 10–15% of sprint capacity is reserved for error budget work, addressing reliability improvements, automation, and technical debt reduction.

Q21: Most of the team’s daily toil has been automated over the past quarter?
✅ Yes, over 80% of repetitive operational tasks have been automated through scripts, CI/CD pipelines, and self-service tools, significantly reducing manual toil.

Q22: Do you discuss toil regularly in team retrospectives and measure it as a percentage of team capacity?
✅ Yes, toil tracking is part of every retrospective. We measure it using internal metrics and aim to keep it below 20% of total team effort.

Q23: Are toil reduction targets set and reflected in performance metrics, encouraging continuous improvement?
✅ Yes, toil reduction goals are included in quarterly OKRs and SRE performance metrics. Continuous automation initiatives are reviewed in leadership syncs.

Q24: Do you use bank standard for access provisioning?
✅ Yes, all access provisioning follows bank security standards with automated workflows through ServiceNow and periodic access reviews for compliance.

Would you like me to make this into a neatly formatted Excel version (ready to paste into your SRE Maturity sheet)? I can create a table with all “Question – Positive Response” pairs formatted for easy update.
