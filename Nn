Subject: Clarification on Missing Address for Security Providers/Charge Holders in Generated Documents

Hi Greg and Ainu,

We have received queries from a few users who are generating documents for companies that are configured as Security Providers or Charge Holders. These entities are associated guarantors in the generated documents. The users have reported that the address details for these guarantors are not appearing in the documents, even though valid addresses are available in CRM.

Following a detailed database and integration analysis, we identified that CRM does not transmit address details for entities categorized as Security Providers or Charge Holders. CRM only sends address information for a Legal Entity (LE) under the following specific conditions:
	1.	The respective LE is part of the Corporate Structure within the Legal Entity Summary.
	2.	A Work Item has been created directly on that LE.
	3.	The LE is associated with a Primary Bank, such as RBS, NatWest, Barclays, etc.

As a result, IFP does not receive or display the address details for these entities in the generated documents.

We would like your input on the following points to confirm the intended system behavior:
	1.	Is the user performing the steps incorrectly — i.e., should the LE always be added under the Corporate Structure if address population is required?
	2.	Or is the user’s expectation incorrect — meaning, letters generated for guarantors or security providers are not expected to include address details from CRM?
	3.	Should we introduce a validation or warning message in IFP indicating that address details will not be available for LEs added only as Security Providers or Charge Holders?
	4.	Should we update the document templates to handle this scenario more appropriately (e.g., suppress the address section or include explanatory text)?

Additionally, we would like to highlight an existing open Jira issue related to inconsistent guarantor name mapping in the letters. For example, in one observed case, the letter was generated for ABC Company, but the guarantor section displayed XYZ with no address information.

Please advise on the expected behavior so that we can determine whether this is a user process gap, a configuration issue, or a potential enhancement needed in IFP or the document templates.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
