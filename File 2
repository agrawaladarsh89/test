Hi Ainu,

Issue:
IFP is generating a Multi-Party Guarantee document even though there is only a single security guarantor. The expected behaviour is to generate a Corporate Guarantee letter, not a multi-party guarantee.

Reported Application:
Invoice Finance Platform – InLife
IFP00048833 DHMB Limited

Impact:
The Document Team is unable to accept the document because the generated output is incorrect.

Root Cause:
As discussed on the call, this occurred because the user added a new security and updated the existing corporate guarantee security. As a result, the application has treated this as two separate securities and generated a multi-party guarantee letter.

JIRA:
(To be raised for the required fix.)

Workaround:
The Corporate Guarantee document is currently being prepared manually by the Docs Team.

Requesting your support to prioritise this and have it fixed in PROD.

Thanks and Regards,

If you want, I can also create a more concise or more formal escalation version.
